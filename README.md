# AgentBridge

AgentBridge is a local programming-agent collaboration platform for bot-driven group chat workflows. It keeps native CLI agents such as Claude Code and Codex running in a visible local terminal while a control plane exposes structured project, session, command, lease, interaction, and audit APIs.

The initial implementation follows the product design in `AgentBridge_项目总设计文档_v0.2_多项目多会话指令版.md`.

## Current Scope

This repository currently contains the first executable backend slice:

- Python/FastAPI Control Plane skeleton.
- Shared domain models for projects, workspaces, sessions, turns, interactions, writer leases, chat contexts, and audit events.
- In-memory repository suitable for contract tests and local MVP prototyping.
- `/agent` command parser and executor for project/session routing, turn enqueueing, lease control, and idempotent invocation handling.
- Ordered semantic event streams with replay and idempotent Terminal Agent event ingestion.
- Optional SQLAlchemy persistence with an Alembic-managed schema.
- Terminal input gateway with fake/tmux backends and writer-lease epoch enforcement.
- Local Terminal Agent daemon over a token-protected Unix socket.
- Local Console Client that acquires human lease on first input and forwards terminal input.
- RenderDocument intermediate representation with OneBot/plain-text fallback rendering.
- Bot Gateway delivery service with persistent idempotent delivery records, in-memory text transport, and OneBot V11 HTTP transport.
- REST API routes aligned with the design document's service interface.

NoneBot integration, Admin Web, visible local console attachment, and real Claude/Codex adapters are planned next milestones.

## Development

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
uv run alembic upgrade head
uv run uvicorn agentbridge.api:create_app --factory --reload
```

Without `uv`, use the active Python environment:

```bash
python3 -m pytest
python3 -m uvicorn agentbridge.api:create_app --factory --reload
```

## Persistence

The app defaults to in-memory storage. Set `AGENTBRIDGE_DATABASE_URL` to enable the SQLAlchemy repository:

```bash
export AGENTBRIDGE_DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./agentbridge.db
uv run alembic upgrade head
uv run uvicorn agentbridge.api:create_app --factory --reload
```

For local throwaway development, `AGENTBRIDGE_AUTO_CREATE_SCHEMA=true` can create tables on startup. Production deployments should run Alembic migrations explicitly.

## Terminal Backend

The API uses a fake terminal backend by default for local contract tests. To use tmux for MVP experiments:

```bash
export AGENTBRIDGE_TERMINAL_BACKEND=tmux
```

Terminal input is accepted only when the request carries the current writer lease `epoch`, owner type, and owner ID. Stale Bot/Web inputs are rejected after human or higher-priority control preempts the lease.

## Local Terminal Agent

Run the local Terminal Agent socket server:

```bash
export AGENTBRIDGE_LOCAL_TOKEN="$(python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))')"
export AGENTBRIDGE_TERMINAL_SOCKET="$HOME/.agentbridge/terminal-agent.sock"
uv run agentbridge-terminal-agent
```

If `AGENTBRIDGE_LOCAL_TOKEN` is omitted, the daemon prints a generated token at startup. The socket file is created with mode `0600`. The JSONL socket protocol currently supports `health`, `start_session`, `acquire_human_lease`, `release_lease`, `submit_input`, and `snapshot`.

## Rendering

Semantic events can be mapped to platform-neutral render documents and plain-text fallback messages:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/sessions/<session-id>/rendered-events
```

The current renderer targets reliable text fallback for OneBot-style platforms. Rich buttons/cards and platform-specific delivery state are planned for the Bot Gateway layer.

## Bot Gateway Delivery

Rendered session events can be delivered through the MVP Bot Gateway service:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/bot-gateway/deliver-session-events \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"session_id":"<session-id>","chat_context_id":"<chat-context-id>"}'
```

Delivery records are idempotent by platform, chat context, event, and message index, and can be persisted through the SQLAlchemy repository. The current transport is in-memory and intended for contract tests; real NoneBot/OneBot delivery is the next integration layer.

To send through a OneBot V11 HTTP endpoint:

```bash
export AGENTBRIDGE_BOT_TRANSPORT=onebot.v11
export AGENTBRIDGE_ONEBOT_HTTP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5700
export AGENTBRIDGE_ONEBOT_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
```

The OneBot transport maps chat contexts with `user_id` to `send_private_msg`; other contexts use `send_group_msg` with `chat_space_id` as `group_id`.

## Console Client

Attach to a session through the local Terminal Agent socket:

```bash
export AGENTBRIDGE_LOCAL_TOKEN=...
export AGENTBRIDGE_TERMINAL_SOCKET="$HOME/.agentbridge/terminal-agent.sock"
uv run agentbridge-console <session-id> --start --command sh
```

The current console runs in line mode. Before forwarding the first line, it requests a `human` writer lease and then sends input with the returned epoch. Use `--send`, `--paste`, or `--snapshot` for scripted checks, and `--release` to release the lease on exit.

## API Smoke Test

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/health
```

The app uses in-memory storage by default, so data is reset when the process exits.
